# SD_policy_and_community_movement
An introduction on how to estimate the effect of different government policies on the community movement. Google recenlty started releasing change in community movement pattern as compared to "normal" days. They hace released the data <a href="https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/">here</a>. In this notebook, we first obtain the values for percentage change and then use ML models to etimate the effect of different Non-Pharamaceutical Intervantions (NPIs) on the community movement. This data also provides a great proxy for social distancing, as observed during COVID-19 pandemic.
